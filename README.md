Icinga Web 2 iTop Module
========================

This module allows you to use an [iTop](https://www.combodo.com/itop-193) instance as an import source for synchronization in [Icinga Director](https://github.com/icinga/icingaweb2-module-director).
For every sync rule, you can choose an import source with a different query from the _Query Phrasebook_ or you can specify your own [OQL](https://wiki.openitop.org/doku.php?id=2_3_0:oql:start) query.

Please have a look at our [Installation instructions](doc/10-Installation.md) to get started.
