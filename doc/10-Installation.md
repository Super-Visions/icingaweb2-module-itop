Installation
============

## Requirements

* Icinga Director (â‰¥ 1.3.0)
* HTTP(s) connectivity to the iTop server

This module may work with older versions of Director but that is untested.

## Install the iTop module

As with any Icinga Web 2 module, installation is pretty straight-forward.
In case you're installing it from source all you have to do is to drop the `itop` module in one of your module paths.
You can examine (and set) the module path(s) in `Configuration > Application`.
In a typical environment you'll probably drop the module to `/usr/share/icingaweb2/modules/itop`.
Please note that the directory name MUST be `itop` and not `icingaweb2-module-itop` or anything else.

Last but not least go to `Configuration > Modules` and enable the `itop` module.
Otherwise you could also do so on CLI by running:
```sh
icingacli module enable itop
```

That's all, now you are ready to define your first [Import Source](20-ImportSource.md) definitions!
